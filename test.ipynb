BUSINESS\\nGENERAL\\nNIKE, Inc. was incorporated in 1967 under the laws of the State of Oregon. As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this \\n\"Annual Report\"), the terms \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our,\" \"NIKE\" and the \"Company\" refer to NIKE, Inc. and its predecessors, subsidiaries \\nand affiliates, collectively, unless the context indicates otherwise.\\nOur principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, \\nequipment, accessories and services. NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products \\nthrough NIKE Direct operations, which are comprised of both NIKE-owned retail stores and sales through our digital platforms \\n(also referred to as \"NIKE Brand Digital\"), to retail accounts and to a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales \\nrepresentatives in nearly all countries around the world. We also offer interactive consumer services and experiences through our \\ndigital platforms. Nearly all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors. Nearly all footwear and apparel \\nproducts are manufactured outside the United States, while equipment products are manufactured both in the United States and \\nabroad.\\nAll references to fiscal 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are to NIKE, Inc.\\'s fiscal years ended May 31, 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020, \\nrespectively. Any references to other fiscal years refer to a fiscal year ending on May 31 of that year.\\nPRODUCTS\\nOur NIKE Brand product offerings are aligned around our consumer construct focused on Men\\'s, Women\\'s and Kids\\'. We also \\ndesign products specifically for the Jordan Brand and Converse. We believe this approach allows us to create products that \\nbetter meet individual consumer needs while accelerating our largest growth opportunities.\\nNIKE\\'s athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are \\nworn for casual or leisure purposes. We place considerable emphasis on innovation and high-quality construction in the \\ndevelopment and manufacturing of our products. Our Men\\'s, Women\\'s and Jordan Brand footwear products currently lead in \\nfootwear sales and we expect them to continue to do so.\\nWe also sell sports apparel, which features the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and \\ndistribution channels as athletic footwear. Our sports apparel, similar to our athletic footwear products, is designed primarily for \\nathletic use, although many of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes, and demonstrates our commitment to \\ninnovation and high-quality construction. Our Men\\'s and Women\\'s apparel products currently lead in apparel sales and we expect \\nthem to continue to do so. We often market footwear, apparel and accessories in \"collections\" of similar use or by category. We \\nalso market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos.\\nWe sell a line of performance equipment and accessories under the NIKE Brand name, including bags, socks, sport balls, \\neyewear, timepieces, digital devices, bats, gloves, protective equipment and other equipment designed for sports activities. We \\nalso sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NIKE IHM, Inc., \\ndoing business as Air Manufacturing Innovation.\\nOur Jordan Brand designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories predominantly focused \\non basketball performance and culture using the Jumpman trademark. Sales and operating results for Jordan Brand products are \\nreported within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments.\\nOur wholly-owned subsidiary brand, Converse, headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, designs, distributes and licenses \\ncasual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell \\ntrademarks. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis.\\nIn addition to the products we sell to our wholesale customers and directly to consumers through our NIKE Direct operations, we \\nhave also entered into license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell, using NIKE-owned trademarks, \\ncertain apparel, digital devices and applications and other equipment designed for sports activities.\\n2023 FORM 10-K   1'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Wdesk Fidelity Content Translations Version 008.001.016', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2023-07-20T22:09:22+00:00', 'author': 'anonymous', 'moddate': '2023-07-26T15:13:52+08:00', 'title': 'Nike 2023 Proxy', 'source': '414759-1-_5_Nike-NPS-Combo_Form-10-K_WR.pdf', 'total_pages': 106, 'page': 5, 'page_label': '6'}, page_content='We also offer interactive consumer services and experiences as well as digital products through our digital platforms, including \\nfitness and activity apps; sport, fitness and wellness content; and digital services and features in retail stores that enhance the \\nconsumer experience.\\nSALES AND MARKETING\\nWe experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth \\nfiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary \\nconsiderably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment, \\nas well as other macroeconomic, strategic, operating and logistics-related factors.\\nBecause NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity and availability of various sports and fitness activities, as \\nwell as changing design trends, affect the demand for our products. We must, therefore, respond to trends and shifts in consumer \\npreferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, styles and categories and influencing \\nsports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a \\nmaterial adverse effect on our sales and profitability. This is a continuing risk. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.\\nOUR MARKETS\\nWe report our NIKE Brand operations based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment \\noperates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and \\nequipment. The Company\\'s reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East & Africa \\n(\"EMEA\"); Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America (\"APLA\"), and include results for the NIKE and Jordan brands. Sales \\nthrough our NIKE Direct operations are managed within each geographic operating segment.\\nConverse is also a reportable operating segment and operates predominately in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing \\nand selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories. Converse direct to consumer operations, including digital commerce, \\nare reported within the Converse operating segment results.\\nUNITED STATES MARKET\\nFor fiscal 2023, NIKE Brand and Converse sales in the United States accounted for approximately 43% of total revenues, \\ncompared to 40% and 39% for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. We sell our products to thousands of retail accounts in \\nthe United States, including a mix of footwear stores, sporting goods stores, athletic specialty stores, department stores, skate, \\ntennis and golf shops and other retail accounts. In the United States, we utilize NIKE sales offices to solicit such sales. During \\nfiscal 2023, our three largest United States customers accounted for approximately 22% of sales in the United States.\\nOur NIKE Direct and Converse direct to consumer operations sell our products to consumers through various digital platforms. In \\naddition, our NIKE Direct and Converse direct to consumer operations sell products through the following number of retail stores \\nin the United States:\\nU.S. RETAIL STORES NUMBER\\nNIKE Brand factory stores  213 \\nNIKE Brand in-line stores (including employee-only stores)  74 \\nConverse stores (including factory stores)  82 \\nTOTAL  369 \\nIn the United States, NIKE has eight significant distribution centers.

We sell our products to retail accounts through our own NIKE Direct \\noperations and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives around the world. We sell to \\nthousands of retail accounts and ship products from 67 distribution centers outside of the United States.

Technical innovation in the design and \\nmanufacturing process of footwear, apparel and athletic equipment receives continued emphasis as we strive to produce \\nproducts that help to enhance athletic performance, reduce injury and maximize comfort, while decreasing our environmental \\nimpact.\\nIn addition to our own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, digital \\ntechnologies, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made \\nup of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists, physicians and other experts who consult with \\nus and review certain designs, materials and concepts for product and manufacturing, design and other process improvements \\nand compliance with product safety regulations around the world. Employee athletes, athletes engaged under sports marketing \\ncontracts and other athletes wear-test and evaluate products during the design and development process.\\nAs we continue to develop new technologies, we are simultaneously focused on the design of innovative products and \\nexperiences incorporating such technologies throughout our product categories and consumer applications. Using market \\nintelligence and research, our various design teams identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in existing categories to \\nrespond to consumer preferences. The proliferation of Nike Air, Zoom, Free, Dri-FIT, Flyknit, FlyEase, ZoomX, Air Max, React and \\nForward technologies, among others, typifies our dedication to designing innovative products.\\nMANUFACTURING\\nNearly all of our footwear and apparel products are manufactured outside the United States by independent manufacturers \\n(\"contract manufacturers\"), many of which operate multiple factories. We are also supplied, primarily indirectly, by a number of \\nmaterials, or \"Tier 2\" suppliers, who provide the principal materials used in footwear and apparel finished goods products. As of \\nMay 31, 2023, we had 146 strategic Tier 2 suppliers.\\nAs of May 31, 2023, our contract manufacturers operated 123 finished goods footwear factories located in 11 countries. For fiscal \\n2023, NIKE Brand footwear finished goods were manufactured by 15 contract manufacturers, many of which operate multiple \\nfactories. The largest single finished goods footwear factory accounted for approximately 9% of total fiscal 2023 NIKE Brand \\nfootwear production. For fiscal 2023, factories in Vietnam, Indonesia and China manufactured approximately 50%, 27% and 18% \\nof total NIKE Brand footwear, respectively. For fiscal 2023, four footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than \\n10% of footwear production and in the aggregate accounted for approximately 58% of NIKE Brand footwear production.\\nAs of May 31, 2023, our contract manufacturers operated 291 finished goods apparel factories located in 31 countries. For fiscal \\n2023, NIKE Brand apparel finished goods were manufactured by 55 contract manufacturers, many of which operate multiple \\nfactories. The largest single finished goods apparel factory accounted for approximately 8% of total fiscal 2023 NIKE Brand \\napparel production.

For fiscal 2023, one apparel contract manufacturer accounted for more than 10% of \\napparel production, and the top five contract manufacturers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 52% of NIKE Brand \\napparel production.\\nNIKE\\'s contract manufacturers buy raw materials for the manufacturing of our footwear, apparel and equipment products. Most \\nraw materials are available and purchased by those contract manufacturers in the countries where manufacturing takes place. \\nThe principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning \\nmaterials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon, polyester and natural fiber textiles, as well as polyurethane films used to make \\nNIKE Air-Sole cushioning components. During fiscal 2023, Air Manufacturing Innovation, a wholly-owned subsidiary, with facilities \\nnear Beaverton, Oregon, in Dong Nai Province, Vietnam, and St. Charles, Missouri, as well as contract manufacturers in China \\nand Vietnam, were our suppliers of NIKE Air-Sole cushioning components used in footwear.\\nThe principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics, yarns and threads (both virgin and \\nrecycled); specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat and repel rain \\nand/or snow; and plastic and metal hardware. \\nIn fiscal 2023, we experienced ongoing supply chain volatility during the first part of the year, which improved gradually during the \\ncourse of the year. We also experienced higher supply chain network costs primarily due to inflationary pressures during the year. \\nDespite competition for certain materials during fiscal 2023, contract manufacturers were able to source sufficient quantities of \\nraw materials for use in our footwear and apparel products. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors, for additional discussion of the impact \\nof sourcing risks on our business.\\nSince 1972, Sojitz Corporation of America (\"Sojitz America\"), a large Japanese trading company and the sole owner of our \\nredeemable preferred stock, has performed import-export financing services for us.\\nINTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADE\\nOur international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad, such as the \\nimplementation of, or potential changes in, foreign and domestic trade policies, increases in import duties, anti-dumping \\nmeasures, quotas, safeguard measures, trade restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and, in certain parts of the world, \\npolitical tensions, instability, conflicts, nationalism and terrorism, and resulting sanctions and other measures imposed in \\nresponse to such issues. We have not, to date, been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such \\nmaterial effects occurring in the future.\\nIn recent years, uncertain global and regional economic and political conditions have affected international trade and increased \\nprotectionist actions around the world. These trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors, and the \\nfootwear and apparel industries, as a whole, are not immune. Companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many \\ndifferent regions, and, in nearly all cases, we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the \\nimpact to the industry, while observing applicable competition laws. Notwithstanding our efforts, protectionist measures have \\nresulted in increases in the cost of our products, and additional measures, if implemented, could adversely affect sales and/or \\nprofitability for NIKE, as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole.\\nWe monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry, and we engage \\nin administrative and judicial processes to mitigate trade restrictions. We are actively monitoring actions that may result in \\nadditional anti-dumping measures and could affect our industry. We are also monitoring for and advocating against other \\nimpediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear, apparel and equipment. NIKE also advocates for \\ntrade liberalization for footwear and apparel in a number of bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements. Changes in, and \\nresponses to, U.S. trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs or penalties on imported goods or retaliatory measures by \\nother countries, have negatively affected, and could in the future negatively affect, U.S. corporations, including NIKE, with \\nbusiness operations and/or consumer markets in those countries, which could also make it necessary for us to change the way \\nwe conduct business, either of which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or our results of operations. \\nIn addition, with respect to proposed trade restrictions, we work with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade \\nassociations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented (i) addresses \\nlegitimate and core concerns, (ii) is consistent with international trade rules and (iii) reflects and considers domestic economies \\nand the important role they may play in the global economic community.\\nWhere trade protection measures are implemented, we believe we have the ability to develop, over a period of time, adequate \\nalternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers. If events prevented us from acquiring products \\nfrom our suppliers in a particular country, our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse \\nfinancial impact. However, we believe we could abate any such disruption, and that much of the adverse impact on supply would, \\ntherefore, be of a short-term nature, although alternate sources of supply might not be as cost-effective and could have an \\nongoing adverse impact on profitability.\\nNIKE, INC.       4'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Wdesk Fidelity Content Translations Version 008.001.016', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2023-07-20T22:09:22+00:00', 'author': 'anonymous', 'moddate': '2023-07-26T15:13:52+08:00', 'title': 'Nike 2023 Proxy', 'source': '414759-1-_5_Nike-NPS-Combo_Form-10-K_WR.pdf', 'total_pages': 106, 'page': 8, 'page_label': '9'}, page_content='Our international operations are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\"), and other \\nanti-bribery laws applicable to our operations.

Important aspects of competition in this industry are:\\n• Product attributes such as quality; performance and reliability; new product style, design, innovation and development; as \\nwell as consumer price/value.\\n• Consumer connection, engagement and affinity for brands and products, developed through marketing, promotion and \\ndigital experiences; social media interaction; customer support and service; identification with prominent and influential \\nathletes, influencers, public figures, coaches, teams, colleges and sports leagues who endorse our brands and use our \\nproducts and active engagement through sponsored sporting events and clinics. \\n• Effective sourcing and distribution of products, with attractive merchandising and presentation at retail, both in-store and on \\ndigital platforms.\\nWe believe that we are competitive in all of these areas.\\nTRADEMARKS AND PATENTS\\nWe believe that our intellectual property rights are important to our brand, our success and our competitive position. We \\nstrategically pursue available protections of these rights and vigorously protect them against third-party theft and infringement.\\nWe use trademarks on nearly all of our products and packaging, and in our marketing materials, and believe having distinctive \\nmarks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying our brands and the \\nCompany, and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others.

We are focused on building an increasingly \\ndiverse talent pipeline that reflects our consumers, athletes and the communities we serve.\\nCULTURE \\nEach employee shapes NIKE\\'s culture through behaviors and practices. This starts with our Maxims, which represent our core \\nvalues and, along with our Code of Conduct, feature the fundamental behaviors that help anchor, inform and guide us and apply \\nto all employees. Our mission is to bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world, which includes the belief that if \\nyou have a body, you are an athlete. We aim to do this by creating groundbreaking sport innovations, making our products more \\nsustainably, building a creative and diverse global team, supporting the well-being of our employees and making a positive impact \\nin communities where we live and work. Our mission is aligned with our deep commitment to maintaining an environment where \\nall NIKE employees have the opportunity to reach their full potential, to connect to our brands and to shape our workplace \\nculture. We believe providing for growth and retention of our employees is essential in fostering such a culture and are dedicated \\nto giving access to training programs and career development opportunities, including trainings on NIKE\\'s values, history and \\nbusiness, trainings on developing leadership skills at all levels, tools and resources for managers and qualified tuition \\nreimbursement opportunities. \\nAs part of our commitment to empowering our employees to help shape our culture, we source employee feedback through our \\nEngagement Survey program, including several corporate pulse surveys. The program provides every employee throughout the \\nglobe an opportunity to provide confidential feedback on key areas known to drive employee engagement, including their \\nsatisfaction with their managers, their work and the Company generally. The program also measures our employees’ emotional \\ncommitment to NIKE as well as NIKE\\'s culture of diversity, equity and inclusion. NIKE also provides multiple points of contact for \\nemployees to speak up if they experience something that does not align with our values or otherwise violates our workplace \\npolicies, even if they are uncertain what they observed or heard is a violation of company policy.\\nAs part of our commitment to make a positive impact on our communities, we maintain a goal of investing 2% of our prior fiscal \\nyear\\'s pre-tax income into global communities. The focus of this investment continues to be inspiring kids to be active through \\nplay and sport as well as uniting and inspiring communities to create a better and more equitable future for all. Our community \\ninvestments are an important part of our culture in that we also support employees in giving back to community organizations \\nthrough donations and volunteering, which are matched by the NIKE Foundation where eligible.\\nEMPLOYEE BASE\\nAs of May 31, 2023, we had approximately 83,700 employees worldwide, including retail and part-time employees. We also \\nutilize independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce.\\nNone of our employees are represented by a union, except certain employees in the EMEA and APLA geographies are members \\nof and/or represented by trade unions, as allowed or required by local law and/or collective bargaining agreements. Also, in some \\ncountries outside of the United States, local laws require employee representation by works councils (which may be entitled to \\ninformation and consultation on certain subsidiary decisions) or by organizations similar to a union. In certain European countries, \\nwe are required by local law to enter into, and/or comply with, industry-wide or national collective bargaining agreements.

If global economic and financial market conditions deteriorate, the \\nfollowing factors, among others, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition:\\n• Our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers. Declines in consumer spending have in the past resulted \\nin and may in the future result in reduced demand for our products, increased inventories, reduced orders from retailers for \\nour products, order cancellations, lower revenues, higher discounts and lower gross margins.\\n• In the future, we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find \\nit desirable to do so.\\n• We conduct transactions in various currencies, which creates exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates \\nrelative to the U.S. Dollar.

The athletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is \\nhighly competitive both in the United States and worldwide. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and \\nleisure footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies, private labels and large \\ncompanies that have diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel and equipment. We also compete with other \\ncompanies for the production capacity of contract manufacturers that produce our products. In addition, we and our contract \\nmanufacturers compete with other companies and industries for raw materials used in our products. Our NIKE Direct operations, \\nboth through our digital commerce operations and retail stores, also compete with multi-brand retailers, which sell our products \\nthrough their digital platforms and physical stores, and with digital commerce platforms. In addition, we compete with respect to \\nthe digital services and experiences we are able to offer our consumers, including fitness and activity apps; sport, fitness and \\nwellness content and services; and digital services and features in retail stores that enhance the consumer experience.\\nProduct offerings, technologies, marketing expenditures (including expenditures for advertising and endorsements), pricing, costs \\nof production, customer service, digital commerce platforms, digital services and experiences and social media presence are \\nareas of intense competition. These, in addition to ongoing rapid changes in technology, a reduction in barriers to the creation of \\nnew footwear and apparel companies and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear, apparel, and \\nequipment, services and experiences, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. In addition, the competitive nature of \\nretail, including shifts in the ways in which consumers shop, and the continued proliferation of digital commerce, constitutes a risk \\nfactor implicating our NIKE Direct and wholesale operations.

Central banks may deploy various strategies to combat inflation, including \\nincreasing interest rates, which may impact our borrowing costs. Additionally, there has been, and may continue to be, volatility in \\ncurrency exchange rates that impact the U.S. Dollar value relative to other international currencies. Our international revenues \\nand expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses are \\naffected by currency fluctuations, specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S. Dollars for \\nconsolidated financial reporting, as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar adversely affects the U.S. Dollar \\nvalue of the Company's foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also \\ndisrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials \\nmore expensive and more difficult to finance. Foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have \\nan adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\\nWe hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency \\nfluctuations on our financial results. Since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility, they not only reduce the \\nnegative impact of a stronger U.S. Dollar or other trading currency, but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. \\nDollar or other trading currency. Our future financial results have in the past been and could in the future be significantly affected \\nby the value of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our \\nfinancial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities.\\nWe may be adversely affected by the financial health of our wholesale customers.\\nWe extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer's financial condition, generally without requiring \\ncollateral. To assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our products, we offer certain customers the opportunity to \\nplace orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program. These advance orders may be canceled \\nunder certain conditions, and the risk of cancellation increases when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers \\nstruggling with economic uncertainty. In the past, some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including \\nbankruptcies, which have had an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. \\nWhen the retail economy weakens or as consumer behavior shifts, retailers tend to be more cautious with orders. A slowing or \\nchanging economy in our key markets, including a recession, could adversely affect the financial health of our customers, which \\nin turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, product sales are dependent \\nin part on high quality merchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumers, which requires continuing \\ninvestments by retailers. Retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them, resulting \\nin lower sales and orders for our products.\\nClimate change and other sustainability-related matters, or legal, regulatory or market responses thereto, may have an \\nadverse impact on our business and results of operations. \\nThere are concerns that increased levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have caused, and \\nmay continue to cause, potentially at a growing rate, increases in global temperatures, changes in weather patterns and \\nincreasingly frequent and/or prolonged extreme weather and climate events. Climate change may also exacerbate challenges \\nrelating to the availability and quality of water and raw materials, including those used in the production of our products, and may \\nresult in changes in regulations or consumer preferences, which could in turn affect our business, operating results and financial \\ncondition. For example, there has been increased focus by governmental and non-governmental organizations, consumers, \\ncustomers, employees and other stakeholders on products that are sustainably made and other sustainability matters, including \\nresponsible sourcing and deforestation, the use of plastic, energy and water, the recyclability or recoverability of packaging and \\nmaterials transparency, any of which may require us to incur increased costs for additional transparency, due diligence and \\nreporting. In addition, federal, state or local governmental authorities in various countries have proposed, and are likely to \\ncontinue to propose, legislative and regulatory initiatives to reduce or mitigate the impacts of climate change on the environment. \\nVarious countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change, which could increase the \\ncomplexity of, and potential cost related to complying with, such regulations. Any of the foregoing may require us to make \\nadditional investments in facilities and equipment, may impact the availability and cost of key raw materials used in the \\nproduction of our products or the demand for our products, and, in turn, may adversely impact our business, operating results \\nand financial condition.\\nAlthough we have announced sustainability-related goals and targets, there can be no assurance that our stakeholders will agree \\nwith our strategies, and any perception, whether or not valid, that we have failed to achieve, or to act responsibly with respect to, \\nsuch matters or to effectively respond to new or additional legal or regulatory requirements regarding climate change, could result \\nin adverse publicity and adversely affect our business and reputation.

Extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores, suppliers, manufacturers, \\ncustomers, distribution centers, offices, headquarters and vendors are located could adversely affect our operating results and \\nfinancial condition. Moreover, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, tsunamis, floods or droughts, whether \\noccurring in the United States or abroad, and their related consequences and effects, including energy shortages and public \\nhealth issues, have in the past temporarily disrupted, and could in the future disrupt, our operations, the operations of our \\nvendors, manufacturers and other suppliers or have in the past resulted in, and in the future could result in, economic instability \\nthat may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. In particular, if a natural disaster or severe weather event \\nwere to occur in an area in which we or our suppliers, manufacturers, employees, customers, distribution centers or vendors are \\nlocated, our continued success would depend, in part, on the safety and availability of the relevant personnel and facilities and \\nproper functioning of our or third parties\\' computer, network, telecommunication and other systems and operations. In addition, a \\nnatural disaster or severe weather event could negatively impact retail traffic to our stores or stores that carry our products and \\ncould have an adverse impact on consumer spending, any of which could in turn result in negative point-of-sale trends for our \\nmerchandise. Further, climate change may increase both the frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions and natural \\ndisasters, which may affect our business operations, either in a particular region or globally, as well as the activities of our third-\\nparty vendors and other suppliers, manufacturers and customers. We believe the diversity of locations in which we operate, our \\noperational size, disaster recovery and business continuity planning and our information technology systems and networks, \\nincluding the Internet and third-party services (\"Information Technology Systems\"), position us well, but may not be sufficient for \\nall or for concurrent eventualities. If we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event or \\nconcurrent events, we could experience operational challenges, in particular depending upon how a local or regional event may \\naffect our human capital across our operations or with regard to particular aspects of our operations, such as key executive \\nofficers or personnel. For example, our world headquarters is located in an active seismic zone, which is at a higher risk for \\nearthquakes and the related consequences or effects. Further, if we are unable to find alternative suppliers, replace capacity at \\nkey manufacturing or distribution locations or quickly repair damage to our Information Technology Systems or supply systems, \\nwe could be late in delivering, or be unable to deliver, products to our customers. These events could result in reputational \\ndamage, lost sales, cancellation charges or markdowns, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of \\noperations and financial condition.\\nOur financial condition and results of operations have been, and could in the future be, adversely affected by a \\npandemic, epidemic or other public health emergency.\\nPandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and other public health emergencies, and preventative measures taken to \\ncontain or mitigate such crises have caused, and may in the future cause, business slowdown or shutdown in affected areas and \\nsignificant disruption in the financial markets, both globally and in the United States. These events have led to and could again \\nlead to adverse impacts to our global supply chain, factory cancellation costs, store closures, and a decline in retail traffic and \\ndiscretionary spending by consumers and, in turn, materially impact our business, sales, financial condition and results of \\noperations as well as cause a volatile effective tax rate driven by changes in the mix of earnings across our jurisdictions.

Any pandemic or public health \\nemergency may also affect our business, results of operations or financial condition in a manner that is not presently known to us \\nor that we currently do not consider to present significant risks and may also exacerbate, or occur concurrently with, other risks \\ndiscussed in this Item 1A. Risk Factors, any of which could have a material effect on us.\\nBusiness and Operational Risks\\nFailure to maintain our reputation, brand image and culture could negatively impact our business.\\nOur iconic brands have worldwide recognition, and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image \\nand reputation. Maintaining, promoting and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts, including \\nadvertising and consumer campaigns, product innovation and product quality. Our commitment to product innovation, quality and \\nsustainability, and our continuing investment in design (including materials), marketing and sustainability measures may not have \\nthe desired impact on our brand image and reputation. In addition, our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our \\nbrand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media and digital environment, including our reliance on social \\nmedia and other digital advertising networks, and digital dissemination of advertising campaigns on our digital platforms and \\nthrough our digital experiences and products. We could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives.\\nOur brand value also depends on our ability to maintain a positive consumer perception of our corporate integrity, purpose and \\nbrand culture. Negative claims or publicity involving us, our culture and values, our products, services and experiences, \\nconsumer data, or any of our key employees, endorsers, sponsors, suppliers or partners could seriously damage our reputation \\nand brand image, regardless of whether such claims are accurate. For example, while we require our suppliers of our products to \\noperate their business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we do not control their practices. Negative publicity \\nrelating to a violation or an alleged violation of policies or laws by such suppliers could damage our brand image and diminish \\nconsumer trust in our brand. Further, our reputation and brand image could be damaged as a result of our support of, association \\nwith or lack of support or disapproval of certain social causes, as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct, or \\nchange, certain of our activities in response to such considerations. Social media, which accelerates and potentially amplifies the \\nscope of negative publicity, can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims. Adverse publicity about regulatory or \\nlegal action against us, or by us, could also damage our reputation and brand image, undermine consumer confidence in us and \\nreduce long-term demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations.

Historically, revenues in the first and fourth \\nfiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary \\nconsiderably from time to time or in the future as a result of strategic shifts in our business and seasonal or geographic demand \\nfor particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment and in connection with the timing of significant sporting events, such as \\nthe NBA Finals, Olympics or the World Cup, among others. In addition, our customers may cancel orders, change delivery \\nschedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice. As a result, we may not be able to accurately predict our \\nquarterly sales. Accordingly, our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period. This seasonality, \\nalong with other factors that are beyond our control, including economic conditions, changes in consumer preferences, weather \\nconditions, outbreaks of disease, social or political unrest, availability of import quotas, transportation disruptions and currency \\nexchange rate fluctuations, has in the past adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect our business and cause our \\nresults of operations to fluctuate. Our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our \\ncontrol, including manufacturing and transportation costs, shifts in product sales mix and geographic sales trends, all of which we \\nexpect to continue. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any \\nfuture period.\\nIf we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products, we may not be able to maintain or \\nincrease our revenues and profits.\\nOur success depends on our ability to identify, originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to \\nchanging consumer demands in a timely manner. However, lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us \\nto respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences. All of our products are subject to changing \\nconsumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. Our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as \\nconsumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of products \\naltogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. If we fail to \\nanticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, \\ndeveloping new products, designs, styles and categories, and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive \\nmarketing, we could experience lower sales, excess inventories or lower profit margins, any of which could have an adverse \\neffect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum \\nof advertising and promotional programs and campaigns, including social media and other digital advertising networks. If we do \\nnot successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase, these factors could have an adverse effect \\non our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nWe rely on technical innovation and high-quality products to compete in the market for our products.\\nTechnical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing processes of footwear, apparel, equipment and other \\nproducts and services are essential to the commercial success of our products and development of new products. Research and \\ndevelopment play a key role in technical innovation. We rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise \\nphysiology, engineering, digital technologies, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, as well as research committees \\nand advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists and other experts to \\ndevelop and test cutting-edge performance products. While we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic \\nperformance and reduce injury and maximize comfort, if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products, consumer \\ndemand for our products could decline, and if we experience problems with the quality of our products, we may incur substantial \\nexpense to remedy the problems and loss of consumer confidence.\\nFailure to continue to obtain or maintain high-quality endorsers of our products could harm our business.\\nWe establish relationships with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues, as well as other public figures, including artists, \\ndesigners and influencers, to develop, evaluate and promote our products, as well as establish product authenticity with \\nconsumers.

Certain \\nstores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities and to \\nintegrate with our digital platforms. Because of their unique design and technological elements, locations and size, these stores \\nrequire substantially more investment than other stores. Due to the high fixed-cost structure associated with our NIKE Direct retail \\nstores, a decline in sales, a shift in consumer behavior away from brick-and-mortar retail, or the closure, temporary or otherwise, \\nor poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and \\nleasehold improvements and employee-related costs.\\nMany factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond our control, pose risks and uncertainties. Risks include, but \\nare not limited to: credit card fraud; mismanagement of existing retail channel partners; inability to manage costs associated with \\nstore construction and operation; and theft. \\nIn addition, we have made significant investments in digital technologies and information systems for the digital aspect of our \\nNIKE Direct operations, and our digital offerings will require continued investment in the development and upgrading of our \\ntechnology platforms.

Information Technology Systems are \\ncritical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service \\ninterruption or shutdown. For example, our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to \\ncustomers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these Information Technology Systems. Over a number of \\nyears, we have implemented Information Technology Systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate. Our work to \\nintegrate, secure and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing and NIKE will continue to \\ninvest in these efforts. We cannot provide assurance, however, that the measures we take to secure and enhance these systems \\nwill be sufficient to protect our Information Technology Systems and prevent cyber-attacks, system failures or data or information \\nloss. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, including as a result of security breaches, viruses, hackers, malware, \\nnatural disasters, vendor business interruptions or other causes, failure to properly maintain, protect, repair or upgrade systems, \\nor problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced \\nefficiency of our operations, could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem which may not be sufficient to \\ncover all eventualities, and may have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition. In \\naddition, the use of employee-owned devices for communications as well as hybrid work arrangements, present additional \\noperational risks to our Information Technology Systems, including, but not limited to, increased risks of cyber-attacks. Further, \\nlike other companies in the retail industry, we have in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, cyber-\\nattacks, including phishing, and other attempts to breach, or gain unauthorized access to, our systems. To date, these attacks \\nhave not had a material impact on our operations, but we cannot provide assurance that they will not have an impact in the \\nfuture.\\nWe also use Information Technology Systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting \\npurposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. From time to time, we have expended, \\nand expect to continue to expend, significant resources to modify, update and enhance our Information Technology Systems and \\nto investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures. These modifications, updates and enhancements may cost more \\nthan initially expected and may not be effective in preventing issues and disruptions. Moreover, due to the complexity of our \\nInformation Technology Systems, the process of implementing modifications or enhancements can itself create a risk of systems \\ndisruptions and security issues. If Information Technology Systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our \\nbusiness continuity plans, or those of our vendors, do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience \\ndelays in reporting our financial results, which could result in lost revenues and profits, as well as reputational damage. \\nFurthermore, we depend on Information Technology Systems and personal data collection for digital marketing, digital commerce, \\nconsumer engagement and the marketing and use of our digital products and services.

Consolidation of our retailers will concentrate our credit risk with a smaller \\nset of retailers, any of whom may experience declining sales or a shortage of liquidity. In addition, increasing market share \\nconcentration among a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially \\nreduces their purchases of our products, we may be unable to find sufficient retail outlets for our products to sustain the same \\nlevel of sales and revenues.\\nIf one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant \\nlosses.\\nAs part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, which may include forward \\ncontracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps with various financial institutions. In addition, we have \\nsignificant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial \\ninstitutions in the United States and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty \\nfinancial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of \\nuncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to \\nrecover losses incurred as a result of default, or our assets deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty, may be limited \\nby the counterparty's liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default \\nor failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of \\noperations and financial condition.\\nWe rely on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of our footwear \\nproducts.\\nAs of May 31, 2023, our contract manufacturers operated 123 finished goods footwear factories located in 11 countries. We rely \\nupon contract manufacturers, which we do not own or operate, to manufacture all of the footwear products we sell. For fiscal \\n2023, four footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10% of footwear production and in the aggregate \\naccounted for approximately 58% of NIKE Brand footwear production. Our ability to meet our customers' needs depends on our \\nability to maintain a steady supply of products from our contract manufacturers. If one or more of our significant suppliers were to \\nsever their relationship with us or significantly alter the terms of our relationship, including due to changes in applicable trade \\npolicies, or be unable to perform, we may not be able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, which could have a \\nmaterial adverse effect on our business operations, sales, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, if any of our \\nprimary footwear contract manufacturers fail to make timely shipments, do not meet our quality standards or otherwise fail to \\ndeliver us product in accordance with our plans, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\\nCertain of our footwear contract manufacturers are highly specialized and only produce a specific type of product. Such contract \\nmanufacturers may go out of business if consumer preferences or market conditions change such that there is no longer \\nsufficient demand for the types of products they produce. If, in the future, the relevant products are again in demand and the \\nspecialized contract manufacturers no longer exist, we may not be able to locate replacement facilities to manufacture certain \\nfootwear products in a timely manner or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales, financial condition or \\nresults of operations.\\nThe market for prime real estate is competitive.\\nOur ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations, both domestically and \\ninternationally, depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease \\neconomics, demographics and other factors. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing real estate leases. In \\naddition, from time to time, we seek to downsize, consolidate, reposition or close some of our real estate locations, which may \\nrequire modification of an existing lease. Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing \\nlocations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores, could have an adverse effect on our \\noperating results and financial condition.\\nAdditionally, the economic environment may make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties \\ndomestically and internationally. This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated \\nrents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our \\nability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of \\nstores, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\\n2023 FORM 10-K   17\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Wdesk Fidelity Content Translations Version 008.001.016', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2023-07-20T22:09:22+00:00', 'author': 'anonymous', 'moddate': '2023-07-26T15:13:52+08:00', 'title': 'Nike 2023 Proxy', 'source': '414759-1-_5_Nike-NPS-Combo_Form-10-K_WR.pdf', 'total_pages': 106, 'page': 21, 'page_label': '22'}, page_content=\"The success of our business depends, in part, on high-quality employees, including key personnel as well as our ability \\nto maintain our workplace culture and values.\\nOur success depends in part on the continued service of high-quality employees, including key executive officers and personnel. \\nThe loss of the services of key individuals, or any negative perception with respect to these individuals, or our workplace culture \\nor values, could harm our business.

Changes in U.S. or international social, political, regulatory and economic \\nconditions could impact our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, political and economic \\ninstability, geopolitical conflicts, political unrest, civil strife, terrorist activity, acts of war, public corruption, expropriation, \\nnationalism and other economic or political uncertainties in the United States or internationally could interrupt and negatively \\naffect the sale of our products or other business operations. Any negative sentiment toward the United States as a result of any \\nsuch changes could also adversely affect our business.\\nIn addition, disease outbreaks, terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad. These \\nfactors, among others, could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials, or our costs for manufacturing and \\nprocuring materials, our ability to import products, our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing \\nbusiness. If any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical, our \\nbusiness could be adversely affected.\\nOur products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing, manufacturing and financing.\\nThe principal materials used in our footwear products — natural and synthetic rubber , plastic compounds, foam cushioning \\nmaterials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon, polyester and natural fiber textiles and polyurethane films — are locally available \\nto manufacturers. The principal materials used in our apparel products — natural and synthetic fabrics, yarns and threads (both \\nvirgin and recycled), specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat and \\nrepel rain and/or snow as well as plastic and metal hardware — are also available in countries where our manufacturing takes \\nplace.

These laws impose additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of \\npersonal data and provide certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored. Compliance with existing, proposed \\nand recently enacted laws and regulations can be costly and time consuming, and any failure to comply with these regulatory \\nstandards could subject us to legal, operational and reputational risks. Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could \\nalso result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others, \\nimposition of fines by governmental authorities and damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on \\nrevenues and profits.\\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws, additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in \\nour effective tax rate.\\nWe earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and, as such, we are subject to the tax laws in the United States \\nand numerous foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations, or their \\ninterpretation and application, in any jurisdiction subject to significant change. \\nProposals to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on global \\nearnings and could increase the U.S. corporate tax rate. For example, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and \\nDevelopment (OECD) and the G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (the \"Inclusive Framework\") has put \\nforth two proposals—Pillar One and Pillar Two—that revise the existing profit allocation and nexus rules and ensure a minimal \\nlevel of taxation, respectively. On December 12, 2022, the European Union member states agreed to implement the Inclusive \\nFramework\\'s global corporate minimum tax rate of 15%. Other countries are also actively considering changes to their tax laws to \\nadopt certain parts of the Inclusive Framework\\'s proposals. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals \\nwill be enacted into law, these changes, if enacted into law, could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate, income tax \\nexpense and cash flows.\\nPortions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are under a tax holiday. We also utilize tax rulings and other \\nagreements to obtain certainty in treatment of certain tax matters. Tax holidays and rulings can expire from time to time and may \\nbe extended when certain conditions are met, or terminated if certain conditions are not met. The impact of any changes in \\nconditions would be the loss of certainty in treatment thus potentially impacting our effective income tax rate. For example, in \\nJanuary 2019, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether the Netherlands has breached State \\nAid rules when granting certain tax rulings to the Company.

Our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, \\nequipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, \"must-have\" \\nproducts, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences \\nthrough digital platforms and at retail.\\nThrough the Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy, we are focused on creating the marketplace of the future with more \\npremium, consistent and seamless consumer experiences, leading with digital and our owned stores, as well as select wholesale \\npartners. In addition, our product creation and marketing organizations are aligned to a consumer construct focused on sports \\ndimensions through Men\\'s, Women\\'s and Kids\\', which allows us to better serve consumer needs. We continue to invest in a new \\nEnterprise Resource Planning Platform, data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering, and other areas to create an end-\\nto-end technology foundation, which we believe will further accelerate our digital transformation.

We will continue to closely monitor macroeconomic conditions, including potential impacts \\nof inflation and rising interest rates on consumer behavior. \\n• Inflationary Pressures:  Inflationary pressures, including higher product input, freight and logistics costs negatively \\nimpacted gross margin for fiscal 2023. The strategic pricing actions we have taken partially offset the impacts of these higher \\ncosts.\\n• Supply Chain Volatility:  Supply chain challenges, macroeconomic conditions and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic \\non the manufacturing of our product disrupted the flow of seasonal product in fiscal 2022 and the first quarter of fiscal 2023, \\nresulting in elevated inventory levels at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Throughout fiscal 2023, we took action to \\nreduce excess inventory by decreasing future inventory purchases and increasing promotional activity. These actions, along \\nwith the stabilization of inventory transit times in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2023, resulted in the normalization of \\nthe seasonal flow of product in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.\\nNIKE, INC.      28'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Wdesk Fidelity Content Translations Version 008.001.016', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2023-07-20T22:09:22+00:00', 'author': 'anonymous', 'moddate': '2023-07-26T15:13:52+08:00', 'title': 'Nike 2023 Proxy', 'source': '414759-1-_5_Nike-NPS-Combo_Form-10-K_WR.pdf', 'total_pages': 106, 'page': 32, 'page_label': '33'}, page_content='• COVID-19 Impacts in Greater China:  During the first and second quarters of fiscal 2023, we managed through continued \\ntemporary store closures and reduced retail traffic in Greater China, primarily due to COVID-19 related local government \\nrestrictions. At the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the government mandated restrictions were lifted and we \\nexperienced improvement in physical retail traffic. \\n• Foreign Currency Impacts: As a global company with significant operations outside the United States, we are exposed to \\nrisk arising from foreign currency exchange rates. For fiscal 2023, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates negatively \\nimpacted our reported Revenues by approximately $2,859 million, reducing our revenue growth rate to 10% on a reported \\nbasis from 16% on a currency-neutral basis. Foreign currency impacts, net of hedges, also reduced our reported Income \\nbefore income taxes by approximately $1,023 million.

However, over \\ntime we expect the future operating model to have a favorable impact on our overall profitability as we reduce selling and \\nadministrative expenses, as well as reduce exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility.\\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\\nThroughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which should be considered in addition \\nto, and not in lieu of, the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. References to these \\nmeasures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in \\naccordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Management \\nuses these non-GAAP measures when evaluating the Company\\'s performance, including when making financial and operating \\ndecisions. Additionally, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial \\ninformation that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. \\nEarnings Before Interest and Taxes (\"EBIT\"): Calculated as Net income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax \\nexpense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Currency-neutral revenues are calculated using actual \\nexchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period in place of the exchange rates in use during the current period.\\nWholesale equivalent revenues: References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total \\nsize of our NIKE Brand market footprint if we had no NIKE Direct operations. NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist \\nof (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our NIKE Direct operations, \\nwhich are charged at prices comparable to those charged to external wholesale customers. \\nCOMPARABLE STORE SALES\\nComparable store sales: This key metric, which excludes NIKE Brand Digital sales, comprises revenues from NIKE-owned in-\\nline and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one \\nyear, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has not been permanently \\nrepositioned within the past year. Comparable store sales includes revenues from stores that were temporarily closed during the \\nperiod as a result of COVID-19.

We manage global foreign exchange risk \\ncentrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of \\nnatural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the \\nremaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation \\nof the NIKE Trading Company (\"NTC\") and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign \\nexchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within our portfolio of foreign exchange \\nexposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying \\nnet exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate \\nmovements on our Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons.

Our most significant \\ntransactional foreign currency exposures are:\\n• Product Costs — NIKE\\'s product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:\\n1. Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:\\na. Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded \\nproducts from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the \\nU.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE \\nentity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.\\nb. Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate \\na foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.\\nIn both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger \\nU.S. Dollar increases its cost.\\n2. Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is \\ndesigned to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories\\' foreign currency \\nexposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our \\npayments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies (\"factory currency exposure \\nindex\") in which the labor, materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded \\nproducts (\"factory input costs\") are denominated.\\nAs an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases \\ndescribed above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices \\nreduces NIKE\\'s U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the indexed foreign currencies \\nincreases our inventory cost.\\n• Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales — A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated \\nwith European operations are earned in currencies other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a \\nsubsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.\\n• Other Costs — Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency \\nrisk, though to a lesser extent. \\n• Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities — Our global subsidiaries have various assets and \\nliabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies \\nother than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create \\nfluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our Consolidated Statements of Income.\\nMANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES\\nTransactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage \\nthese exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect \\nto use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted \\nfuture cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs \\ndescribed above. Generally, these are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\\n2023 FORM 10-K   43'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Wdesk Fidelity Content Translations Version 008.001.016', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2023-07-20T22:09:22+00:00', 'author': 'anonymous', 'moddate': '2023-07-26T15:13:52+08:00', 'title': 'Nike 2023 Proxy', 'source': '414759-1-_5_Nike-NPS-Combo_Form-10-K_WR.pdf', 'total_pages': 106, 'page': 47, 'page_label': '48'}, page_content='Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated \\nmonetary assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement are not formally designated as hedging instruments. Accordingly, \\nchanges in fair value of these instruments are recognized in Other (income) expense, net and are intended to offset the foreign \\ncurrency impact of the remeasurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability being hedged. \\nTRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES\\nMany of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange \\nrates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows \\nof these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries\\' non-U.S. Dollar \\ndenominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to \\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Shareholders\\' equity. In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of \\nIncome, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger \\nU.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our \\nconsolidated Revenues was a detriment of approximately $2,859 million, $295 million and a benefit of approximately $893 million \\nfor the years ended May 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the \\ntranslation of our Income before income taxes was a detriment of approximately $824 million, $87 million and a benefit of \\napproximately $260 million for the years ended May 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\\nMANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES\\nTo minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated \\nreporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The \\nvariable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar denominated investments at \\nnon-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under \\ngenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"). We utilize forward contracts and/or \\noptions to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination \\nof the purchase and sale of the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-\\nover-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold.

Refer to Note 5 — Short-Term \\nBorrowings and Credit Lines for additional information.\\nWe currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor\\'s Corporation and Moody\\'s Investor Services, \\nrespectively. As it relates to our committed credit facilities entered into on March 11, 2022 and March 10, 2023, if our long-term \\ndebt ratings were to decline, the facility fees and interest rates would increase. Conversely, if our long-term debt ratings were to \\nimprove, the facility fees and interest rates would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt ratings would not trigger acceleration \\nof maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities. Under these \\nfacilities, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on the disposal of assets and the amount of debt \\nsecured by liens we may incur. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under these facilities, failed to meet any \\ncovenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the applicable syndicate, any borrowings would \\nbecome immediately due and payable.

Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying \\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the \\npreparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nWe believe the assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting estimates described below have the greatest potential \\nimpact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. Management has \\nreviewed and discussed these critical accounting estimates with the Audit & Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.\\nBecause of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in the preparation of \\nour Consolidated Financial Statements. Within the context of these critical accounting estimates, we are not currently aware of \\nany reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.\\nSALES-RELATED RESERVES\\nProvisions for anticipated sales returns consist of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns. Provisions \\nfor post-invoice sales discounts consist of both contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted \\nat a later date.\\nEstimates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts and claims are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identification of \\noutstanding returns not yet received from customers and outstanding discounts and claims and (3) estimated returns, discounts \\nand claims expected but not yet finalized with customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently \\nuncertain and may differ from estimates recorded. If actual or expected future returns, discounts or claims were significantly \\ndifferent than reserves established, a reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period in which such \\ndetermination was made.\\nRefer to Note 14 — Revenues in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. \\nINVENTORY RESERVES\\nWe make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand \\nand market conditions. If we estimate the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on \\nour books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. \\nThis reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions to the estimated net \\nrealizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made \\nsuch a determination. \\nHEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES\\nWe use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain non-\\nfunctional currency monetary assets and liabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, \\nchanges in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in Accumulated other \\ncomprehensive income (loss), rather than Net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income. In most cases, \\nthis results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into \\nNet income sometime after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional \\nvalue of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of the designated amount of anticipated transactions. By their very \\nnature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When \\nthe designated amount of anticipated or actual transactions decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable a \\nforecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time \\nthereafter, we reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from \\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease \\noccurs. In rare circumstances, the additional period of time may exceed two months due to extenuating circumstances related to \\nthe nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside our control or influence.\\nRefer to Note 12 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for \\nadditional information.\\n2023 FORM 10-K   47'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Wdesk Fidelity Content Translations Version 008.001.016', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2023-07-20T22:09:22+00:00', 'author': 'anonymous', 'moddate': '2023-07-26T15:13:52+08:00', 'title': 'Nike 2023 Proxy', 'source': '414759-1-_5_Nike-NPS-Combo_Form-10-K_WR.pdf', 'total_pages': 106, 'page': 51, 'page_label': '52'}, page_content='INCOME TAXES\\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States, as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. The determination of our \\nprovision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex \\ntax laws. On an interim basis, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual effective tax rate is \\nthen applied to the year-to-date Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the \\nyear-to-date Income tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in \\nwhich they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by \\njurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for \\nthe fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs.\\nOn a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the \\namount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, \\nsettled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an \\nadditional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES \\nABOUT MARKET RISK\\nIn the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial \\ninstruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these \\nfinancial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter into these \\ntransactions for trading or speculative purposes.\\nWe are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding \\nactivities. Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of \\ncurrency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We use forward and option \\ncontracts to hedge certain anticipated, but not yet firmly committed, transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the \\nrelated receivables and payables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. Where exposures are hedged, our \\nprogram has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nThe timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our \\nhedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the \\nCompany may enter into hedge contracts starting 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place \\nincremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The majority of derivatives \\noutstanding as of May 31, 2023, are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British \\nPound/Euro, Chinese Yuan/U.S. Dollar, and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. Refer to Note 12 — Risk Management and \\nDerivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\\nOur earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this \\ninterest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing \\ncosts. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, and fixed-rate debt of varying maturities.\\nMARKET RISK MEASUREMENT\\nWe monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of \\nmarket value, sensitivity analysis and Value-at-Risk (\"VaR\"). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are \\nforeign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, intercompany loans denominated in non-functional \\ncurrencies and fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt.\\nWe use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative \\ninstruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-\\nsensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. There \\nare various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships \\nbetween currencies and interest rates (a \"variance/co-variance\" technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign \\nexchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one-year period. The value of foreign currency \\noptions does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potential loss in \\noption value for the estimated sensitivity (the \"delta\" and \"gamma\") to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation \\nreflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such \\nrate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances and \\naccounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments.\\nThe VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it \\nconsider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss \\nthat may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates \\nand interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.\\nThe estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived \\nusing the VaR model, was $111 million and $99 million as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The VaR increased year-over-\\nyear as a result of an increase in foreign currency volatilities as of May 31, 2023. Such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our \\nderivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change \\nin the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $289 million and $170 million \\nduring fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively.\\nThe instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies and fixed interest rate \\nU.S. Dollar denominated debt. Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, our \\nnon-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward \\n2023 FORM 10-K   49'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Wdesk Fidelity Content Translations Version 008.001.016', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2023-07-20T22:09:22+00:00', 'author': 'anonymous', 'moddate': '2023-07-26T15:13:52+08:00', 'title': 'Nike 2023 Proxy', 'source': '414759-1-_5_Nike-NPS-Combo_Form-10-K_WR.pdf', 'total_pages': 106, 'page': 53, 'page_label': '54'}, page_content='contracts, which are included in the VaR calculation above.

NIKE, Inc. portfolio brands include the NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand and Converse. The NIKE \\nBrand is focused on performance athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services across Men\\'s, Women\\'s and \\nKids\\', amplified with sport-inspired lifestyle products carrying the Swoosh trademark, as well as other NIKE Brand trademarks. \\nThe Jordan Brand is focused on athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories using the Jumpman trademark. Sales and \\noperating results of Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments. \\nConverse designs, distributes, licenses and sells casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, \\nAll Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. In some markets outside the U.S., these trademarks are licensed \\nto third parties who design, distribute, market and sell similar products. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a \\nstand-alone basis.\\nBASIS OF CONSOLIDATION\\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\" or \"NIKE\"). All \\nsignificant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. \\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\\nRevenue transactions associated with the sale of NIKE Brand footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as Converse products, \\ncomprise a single performance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct \\nto consumer channels. The Company satisfies the performance obligation and records revenues when transfer of control to the \\ncustomer has occurred, based on the terms of sale. A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use \\nand receive substantially all of the benefits of the product. \\nControl is transferred to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the \\nagreement with the customer. Control transfers to retail store customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital \\ncommerce customers upon shipment. The transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated \\nsales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the \\ncountry of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt \\nby the wholesale customer. Payment is due at the time of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions.\\nConsideration for trademark licensing contracts is earned through sales-based or usage-based royalty arrangements, and the \\nassociated revenues are recognized over the license period. \\nTaxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing \\ntransaction, and are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from Revenues and Cost of sales in the \\nConsolidated Statements of Income. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product \\nhas transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in Cost of sales when the related revenues \\nare recognized.\\nSALES-RELATED RESERVES\\nConsideration promised in the Company\\'s contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions, such as sales \\nreturns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. The Company estimates the most likely amount it will be entitled to \\nreceive and records an anticipated reduction against Revenues, with an offsetting increase to Accrued liabilities at the time \\nrevenues are recognized. The estimated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current \\nassets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\nThe provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns. \\nProvisions for post-invoice sales discounts consist of both contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to \\nbe granted at a later date.\\nEstimates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts and claims are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identification of \\noutstanding returns not yet received from customers and outstanding discounts and claims and (3) estimated returns, discounts \\nand claims expected but not yet finalized with customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently \\nuncertain and thus may differ from estimates recorded. If actual or expected future returns, discounts or claims are significantly \\ngreater or lower than the reserves established, a reduction or increase to net Revenues is recorded in the period in which such \\ndetermination is made.\\n2023 FORM 10-K   61'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Wdesk Fidelity Content Translations Version 008.001.016', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2023-07-20T22:09:22+00:00', 'author': 'anonymous', 'moddate': '2023-07-26T15:13:52+08:00', 'title': 'Nike 2023 Proxy', 'source': '414759-1-_5_Nike-NPS-Combo_Form-10-K_WR.pdf', 'total_pages': 106, 'page': 65, 'page_label': '66'}, page_content=\"COST OF SALES\\nCost of sales consists primarily of inventory costs, as well as warehousing costs (including the cost of warehouse labor), third-\\nparty royalties, certain foreign currency hedge gains and losses and product design costs. Shipping and handling costs are \\nexpensed as incurred and included in Cost of sales.\\nDEMAND CREATION EXPENSE\\nDemand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, complimentary \\nproducts, television, digital and print advertising as well as media costs, brand events and retail brand presentation. Advertising \\nproduction costs are expensed the first time an advertisement is run. Advertising media costs are expensed when the \\nadvertisement appears. Costs related to brand events are expensed when the event occurs. Costs related to retail brand \\npresentation are expensed when the presentation is complete and delivered.\\nA significant amount of the Company's promotional expenses result from payments under endorsement contracts. In general, \\nendorsement payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. However, certain contracts contain \\nelements that may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. Prepayments \\nmade under contracts are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Deferred income taxes and other assets \\ndepending on the period to which the prepayment applies.\\nCertain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sport (e.g., winning a \\nchampionship). The Company records Demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific \\ngoal.\\nCertain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an \\nextended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). When the Company determines payments are \\nprobable, the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on the Company's best \\nestimate of the endorser's performance. In these instances, to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from the \\nCompany's estimate due to changes in the endorser's performance, adjustments to Demand creation expense may be recorded \\nin a future period.\\nCertain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products, \\nwhich the Company records in Cost of sales as the related sales occur. For contracts containing minimum guaranteed royalty \\npayments, the Company records the amount of any guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product within \\nDemand creation expense.\\nThrough cooperative advertising programs, the Company reimburses its wholesale customers for certain costs of advertising the \\nCompany's products. To the extent the Company receives a distinct good or service in exchange for consideration paid to the \\ncustomer that does not exceed the fair value of that good or service, the amounts reimbursed are recorded in Demand creation \\nexpense.\\nTotal Demand creation expense was $4,060 million, $3,850 million and $3,114 million for the years ended May 31, 2023, 2022 \\nand 2021, respectively. Prepaid advertising and promotion expenses totaled $755 million and $773 million at May 31, 2023 and \\n2022, respectively, of which $372 million and $329 million, respectively, were recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current \\nassets, and $383 million and $444 million, respectively, were recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets, depending on \\nthe period to which the prepayment applied.\\nOPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSE\\nOperating overhead expense consists primarily of wage and benefit-related expenses, research and development costs, bad \\ndebt expense as well as other administrative expenses such as rent, depreciation and amortization, professional services, certain \\ntechnology investments, meetings and travel.\\nCASH AND EQUIVALENTS\\nCash and equivalents represent cash and short-term, highly liquid investments, that are both readily convertible to known \\namounts of cash and so near their maturity they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest \\nrates, with maturities three months or less at the date of purchase.\\nNIKE, INC.      62\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Wdesk Fidelity Content Translations Version 008.001.016', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2023-07-20T22:09:22+00:00', 'author': 'anonymous', 'moddate': '2023-07-26T15:13:52+08:00', 'title': 'Nike 2023 Proxy', 'source': '414759-1-_5_Nike-NPS-Combo_Form-10-K_WR.pdf', 'total_pages': 106, 'page': 66, 'page_label': '67'}, page_content=\"SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS\\nShort-term investments consist of highly liquid investments with maturities over three months at the date of purchase.

Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification. \\nThe Company considers all available-for-sale debt securities, including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months, as available \\nto support current operational liquidity needs and, therefore, classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond three months at \\nthe date of purchase as current assets within Short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\nRefer to Note 4 — Fair Value Measurements for more information on the Company's Short-term investments.\\nALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE\\nAccounts receivable, net consist primarily of amounts due from customers. The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to \\nthe collectability of its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for expected losses resulting from the inability of its \\ncustomers to make required payments. In addition to judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on \\nongoing credit evaluations, the Company considers historical levels of credit losses, as well as macroeconomic and industry \\ntrends to determine the amount of the allowance. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $35 million and $34 \\nmillion as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\\nINVENTORY VALUATION\\nInventories, substantially all of which are finished goods, are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value and valued on either \\nan average or a specific identification cost basis. In some instances, the Company ships products directly from its suppliers to the \\ncustomer, with the related inventory and cost of sales recognized on a specific identification basis. Inventory costs primarily \\nconsist of product cost from the Company's suppliers, as well as inbound freight, import duties, taxes, insurance, logistics and \\nother handling fees.\\nPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION\\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is determined on a straight-line basis for land improvements, \\nbuildings and leasehold improvements over 2 to 40 years and for machinery and equipment over 2 to 15 years.\\nDepreciation and amortization of assets used in manufacturing, warehousing and product distribution are recorded in Cost of \\nsales. Depreciation and amortization of all other assets are recorded in Operating overhead expense.\\nSOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS\\nExpenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized over 2 to 12 \\nyears on a straight-line basis. The Company's policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs associated with \\ndeveloping or obtaining internal use computer software. The Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payroll-related costs \\nfor employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects. The amount of capitalizable payroll costs \\nwith respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects. Costs associated with preliminary project \\nstage activities, training, maintenance and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred.\\nDevelopment costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed as an integral part of a product are subject to \\ncapitalization beginning when a product's technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available \\nfor general release to customers. In most instances, the Company's products are released soon after technological feasibility has \\nbeen established; therefore, software development costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are \\nusually not significant, and generally, most software development costs have been expensed as incurred.\\n2023 FORM 10-K   63\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Wdesk Fidelity Content Translations Version 008.001.016', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2023-07-20T22:09:22+00:00', 'author': 'anonymous', 'moddate': '2023-07-26T15:13:52+08:00', 'title': 'Nike 2023 Proxy', 'source': '414759-1-_5_Nike-NPS-Combo_Form-10-K_WR.pdf', 'total_pages': 106, 'page': 67, 'page_label': '68'}, page_content='IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS\\nThe Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or \\nchanges in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an \\nimpairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant \\nadverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the \\nobservable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, the Company would assess the \\nrecoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected \\nundiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life \\nof the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not \\nrecoverable, the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would \\ntypically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset \\ngroup\\'s carrying amount and its estimated fair value.\\nGOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS\\nThe Company performs annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of \\neach fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a \\nreporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value. \\nFor purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, the Company allocates goodwill across its reporting units, which are considered \\nthe Company\\'s operating segments. For both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which primarily consist of acquired \\ntrade names and trademarks, the Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that \\nthe fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the \\ntotality of events and circumstances, the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or \\nindefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount, an impairment test is unnecessary. \\nIf an impairment test is necessary, the Company will estimate the fair value of the related reporting unit or indefinite-lived \\nintangible asset. If the carrying value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of \\nthat reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is determined to be impaired and the Company will record an impairment \\ncharge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the related fair value. \\nThere were no accumulated impairment losses as of May 31, 2023 and 2022. Additionally, the impact to Goodwill as a result of \\nacquisitions and divestitures during fiscal 2023 and 2022, was not material.\\nOPERATING LEASES\\nThe Company primarily leases retail store space, certain distribution and warehouse facilities, office space, equipment and other \\nnon-real estate assets. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception and begins recording lease activity at \\nthe commencement date, which is generally the date in which the Company takes possession of or controls the physical use of \\nthe asset. Lease components are not separated from non-lease components for real estate leases within the Company\\'s lease \\nportfolio. Right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the \\nlease term with lease expense recognized on a straight-line basis. The Company\\'s incremental borrowing rate is used to \\ndetermine the present value of future lease payments unless the implicit rate is readily determinable. \\nLease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses, renewal or termination options, rent holidays or certain landlord \\nincentives, including tenant improvement allowances. ROU assets include amounts for scheduled rent increases and are reduced \\nby the amount of lease incentives. The lease term includes the non-cancelable period of the lease and options to extend or \\nterminate the lease when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise those options. The Company does not record leases \\nwith an initial term of 12 months or less on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognizes related lease payments in the \\nConsolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Certain lease agreements include variable lease \\npayments, which are based on a percent of retail sales over specified levels or adjust periodically for inflation as a result of \\nchanges in a published index, primarily the Consumer Price Index, and are expensed as incurred.\\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\\nThe Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives, equity \\nsecurities and available-for-sale debt securities. Fair value is the price the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to \\ntransfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. The Company uses a three-level \\nhierarchy that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used, as follows:\\nNIKE, INC.      64'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Wdesk Fidelity Content Translations Version 008.001.016', 'creator': 'Workiva', 'creationdate': '2023-07-20T22:09:22+00:00', 'author': 'anonymous', 'moddate': '2023-07-26T15:13:52+08:00', 'title': 'Nike 2023 Proxy', 'source': '414759-1-_5_Nike-NPS-Combo_Form-10-K_WR.pdf', 'total_pages': 106, 'page': 68, 'page_label': '69'}, page_content='• Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\\n• Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; these include \\nquoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in \\nmarkets that are not active.\\n• Level 3: Unobservable inputs with little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own \\nassumptions.\\nThe Company\\'s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires \\njudgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based \\non the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\\nPricing vendors are utilized for a majority of Level 1 and Level 2 investments. These vendors either provide a quoted market price \\nin an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include \\nbroker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit risks. The fair value \\nof derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily market foreign currency rates, forward \\npricing curves, currency volatilities, currency correlations and interest rates and considers nonperformance risk of the Company \\nand its counterparties. \\nThe Company\\'s fair value measurement process includes comparing fair values to another independent pricing vendor to ensure \\nappropriate fair values are recorded.\\nRefer to Note 4 — Fair Value Measurements for additional information.\\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS\\nAdjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. Dollars are included in the foreign \\ncurrency translation adjustment, a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\\nThe Company\\'s global subsidiaries have various monetary assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, which are \\ndenominated in currencies other than their functional currency. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement, the \\nimpact of which is recorded in Other (income) expense, net, within the Consolidated Statements of Income.\\nACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and \\ninterest rates. All derivatives are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of \\nderivative financial instruments are either recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), Long-term debt or Net \\nincome depending on the nature of the underlying exposure, whether the derivative is formally designated as a hedge and, if \\ndesignated, the extent to which the hedge is effective. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from derivatives in \\nthe same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items. For undesignated hedges and designated cash flow hedges, \\nthis is primarily within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For \\ndesignated net investment hedges, this is within the Cash provided by investing activities component of the Consolidated \\nStatements of Cash Flows. For the Company\\'s fair value hedges, which are interest rate swaps used to mitigate the change in \\nfair value of its fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates, the related cash flows from periodic interest payments are \\nreflected within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \\nRefer to Note 12 — Risk Management and Derivatives for additional information on the Company\\'s risk management program \\nand derivatives.\\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, of equity awards \\nand recognizing the related expense as Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense, as applicable, in the Consolidated \\nStatements of Income on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Substantially all awards vest ratably over four years of \\ncontinued employment, with stock options expiring 10 years from the date of grant. Performance-based restricted stock units vest \\nbased on the Company\\'s achievement of certain performance criteria throughout the three-year performance period and \\ncontinued employment through the vesting date. The fair value of options, stock appreciation rights and employees\\' purchase \\nrights under the employee stock purchase plans (\"ESPPs\") is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair \\nvalue of restricted stock and time-vesting restricted stock units is established by the market price on the date of grant.

This approach requires the recognition of deferred \\ntax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and \\nthe tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount \\nmanagement believes is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable \\nearnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, the Company assesses taxable income in prior carryback periods, the \\nscheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. The Company \\nuses forecasts of taxable income and considers foreign tax credit utilization in making this assessment of realization, which are \\ninherently uncertain and can result in significant variation between estimated and actual results. To the extent the Company \\nbelieves that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established against the net deferred tax asset, which increases the \\nCompany\\'s income tax expense in the period when such determination is made.\\nThe Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not \\nthe position will be sustained upon examination by relevant tax authorities. The Company recognizes interest and penalties \\nrelated to income tax matters in Income tax expense.\\nRefer to Note 7 — Income Taxes for further discussion.\\nEARNINGS PER SHARE\\nBasic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing Net income by the weighted average number of common shares \\noutstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by adjusting weighted average outstanding shares, \\nassuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards.\\nRefer to Note 10 — Earnings Per Share for further discussion.\\nMANAGEMENT ESTIMATES\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to \\nmake estimates, including estimates relating to assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and \\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and \\nexpenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Additionally, the macroeconomic \\nenvironment could remain volatile as the risk exists that worsening macroeconomic conditions could have a material, adverse \\nimpact on future revenue growth as well as overall profitability. \\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\\nIn September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") ASU \\n2022-04, Liabilities — Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations, which \\nenhances transparency surrounding the use of supplier finance programs. The new guidance requires qualitative and quantitative \\ndisclosure sufficient to enable users of the financial statements to understand the nature, activity during the period, changes from \\nperiod to period and potential magnitude of such programs. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after \\nDecember 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal periods, except for the amendment on rollforward information, \\nwhich is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023.

Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 \\nmonths in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the \\nforecasted transaction occurs.

As of May 31, \\n2023, the maximum term over which the Company hedges exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted \\ntransactions was 27 months.\\nFAIR VALUE HEDGES\\nThe Company has, in the past, been exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to \\nchanges in interest rates. Derivatives used by the Company to hedge this risk are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps. \\nThe Company had no interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges as of May 31, 2023. \\nNET INVESTMENT HEDGES\\nThe Company has, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge the risk of variability in foreign currency-denominated net \\ninvestments in wholly-owned international operations. All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment \\nhedges are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) along with the foreign currency translation adjustments \\non those investments. The Company had no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2023.\\nUNDESIGNATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\\nThe Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and \\nliabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or \\nliability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in Other (income) expense, \\nnet, together with the remeasurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. The total notional amount of \\noutstanding undesignated derivative instruments was $4.7 billion as of May 31, 2023.\\nCREDIT RISK\\nThe Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments. The \\ncounterparties to all derivative transactions are major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings; however, this \\ndoes not eliminate the Company's exposure to credit risk with these institutions. This credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains \\nin such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. To manage this risk, the Company has \\nestablished strict counterparty credit guidelines that are continually monitored.\\nThe Company's derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features designed to protect against significant \\ndeterioration in counterparties' creditworthiness and their ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal \\ncourse of business. The Company's bilateral credit-related contingent features generally require the owing entity, either the \\nCompany or the derivative counterparty, to post collateral for the portion of the fair value in excess of $50 million should the fair \\nvalue of outstanding derivatives per counterparty be greater than $50 million.

In the opinion of management, based on its current knowledge and after consultation with \\ncounsel, the Company does not believe any currently pending legal matters will have a material adverse impact on the \\nCompany's results of operations, financial position or cash flows, except as described below.\\nBELGIAN CUSTOMS CLAIM\\nThe Company has received claims for certain years from the Belgian Customs Authorities for alleged underpaid duties related to \\nproducts imported beginning in fiscal 2018. The Company disputes these claims and has engaged in the appellate process. The \\nCompany has issued bank guarantees in order to appeal the claims. At this time, the Company is unable to estimate the range of \\nloss and cannot predict the final outcome as it could take several years to reach a resolution on this matter. If this matter is \\nultimately resolved against the Company, the amounts owed, including fines, penalties and other consequences relating to the \\nmatter, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\\nNOTE\\xa017 — LEASES\\nLease expense is recognized in Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense within the Consolidated Statements of Income, \\nbased on the underlying nature of the leased asset.
